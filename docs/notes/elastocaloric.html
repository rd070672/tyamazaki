          Elastocaloric cooling is a relatively new technology that utilizes the elastic energy of a material to produce cooling effects. This technology is based on the principle that when a material is subjected to an external stress, it can experience a temperature change, known as the elastocaloric effect. The technology has been shown to be a promising alternative to traditional cooling methods, such as vapor compression refrigeration. In this review, we will discuss the historical overview, mechanism and constitutive equations, general issues, the greatest discoveries, recent advancements, overcoming key challenges, relevant technologies, methods of theoretical calculation, methods of numerical simulation, methods of experimental measurement and analysis, applications for basic science, applications for industry, scientific perspective, innovative impact on society, market potential, significant national projects in the United States, China, Europe, and Japan, top 5 high-profile press releases, top 5 high-profile books, and top 5 highly cited prominent researchers in the field of elastocaloric cooling.

          Historical overview:
          The concept of elastocaloric cooling was first proposed by Lord Kelvin in 1852, who described the idea of using the elastic energy of a material to produce cooling effects. However, it wasn't until the early 2000s that the technology began to gain traction, with the development of new materials and techniques that made it possible to produce a significant cooling effect. In recent years, the technology has been the subject of intense research, with many groups working to improve its efficiency and develop new materials that can be used for elastocaloric cooling.

          Mechanism and constitutive equations:
          The elastocaloric effect is based on the fact that when a material is subjected to an external stress, it can experience a temperature change. The exact mechanism by which this occurs depends on the material in question. In general, the elastocaloric effect is caused by changes in the volume of the material due to the applied stress. The constitutive equations that describe the elastocaloric effect are generally based on the thermodynamic properties of the material.

          General issues:
          One of the main challenges facing elastocaloric cooling is the need to develop materials that can produce a significant cooling effect. Many of the materials that have been investigated for elastocaloric cooling have not been able to produce a large enough cooling effect to be practical. Additionally, there are a number of other issues that need to be addressed, such as the need to develop efficient methods for applying the stress to the material and the need to develop techniques for measuring the cooling effect.

          The greatest discoveries:
          One of the greatest discoveries in the field of elastocaloric cooling was the discovery that certain ferroelectric materials can produce a large cooling effect when subjected to an external stress. This discovery has led to the development of a number of new materials that can be used for elastocaloric cooling. Additionally, the development of new techniques for applying the stress to the material has also been a significant breakthrough, as it has made it possible to produce a larger cooling effect.

          Recent advancements:
          Recent advancements in the field of elastocaloric cooling include the development of new materials, such as shape memory alloys and magnetocaloric materials, that can be used for elastocaloric cooling. Additionally, new techniques for applying the stress to the material have also been developed, such as the use of magnetic fields. There has also been significant progress in the development of new methods for measuring the cooling effect, such as the use of calorimetry.

          Overcoming key challenges:
          One of the key challenges facing elastocaloric cooling is the need to develop materials that can produce a significant cooling effect. To overcome thischallenge, researchers have been investigating a wide range of materials, including ferroelectric materials, shape memory alloys, and magnetocaloric materials. Additionally, scientists have been working to improve the efficiency of the stress application methods, such as using magnetic fields, to enhance the cooling effect. Another major challenge is the need to develop methods for measuring the cooling effect that are both accurate and reliable. In recent years, advances in calorimetry have improved the accuracy of measurements, and scientists are now able to measure the cooling effect in a more precise manner.

          Relevant technologies:
          Elastocaloric cooling technology is related to other cooling technologies such as vapor compression refrigeration, magnetic refrigeration, and thermoelectric cooling. However, it has certain advantages over these technologies, such as being more environmentally friendly and being able to operate at higher temperatures. Additionally, elastocaloric cooling can be integrated with other technologies, such as thermoelectric generators, to create a more efficient cooling system.

          Methods of theoretical calculation:
          Theoretical calculations of the elastocaloric effect are based on the thermodynamic properties of the material and the stress applied to it. These calculations are generally performed using finite element analysis (FEA) or molecular dynamics simulations. These methods allow scientists to predict the cooling effect of a material under different stress conditions, and to optimize the material properties for maximum cooling.

          Methods of numerical simulation:
          Numerical simulations are used to model the behavior of elastocaloric materials under different stress conditions. These simulations are generally performed using finite element analysis (FEA) or molecular dynamics simulations. These methods allow scientists to predict the cooling effect of a material under different stress conditions, and to optimize the material properties for maximum cooling.

          Methods of experimental measurement and analysis:
          Experimental measurements of the elastocaloric effect are generally performed using calorimetry. This method involves measuring the heat flow into or out of the material as a function of temperature. Additionally, scientists use strain gauges or other methods to measure the stress applied to the material. These methods allow for the precise measurement of the cooling effect and the optimization of the material properties for maximum cooling.

          Applications for basic science:
          Elastocaloric cooling has a wide range of applications in basic science, including the study of thermodynamics, materials science, and solid-state physics. Additionally, it has potential applications in the study of phase transitions, such as the study of ferroelectric materials and the behavior of shape memory alloys.

          Applications for industry:
          Elastocaloric cooling has a wide range of industrial applications, including refrigeration and air conditioning, energy storage, and power generation. Additionally, it has potential applications in the aerospace and automotive industries, as well as in the field of cryogenics.

          Scientific perspective:
          From a scientific perspective, elastocaloric cooling is a relatively new technology that is still in the early stages of development. However, it has the potential to revolutionize the field of cooling, as it offers a more environmentally friendly and efficient alternative to traditional cooling methods. Additionally, the technology has a wide range of applications in both basic science and industry, making it an exciting area of research for scientists.

          Innovative impact on society:
          Elastocaloric cooling has the potential to have a significant impact on society, as it offers a more environmentally friendly and efficient alternative to traditional cooling methods. Additionally, it has the potential to reduce energy consumption and costs, making it an attractive technology for both industry and consumers.
